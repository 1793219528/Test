●A generative model G that captures the data distribution, **
and a discriminative model D that estimates
the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G.
The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. 

●The discriminator receives a sample, but it is not told where the sample comes from. 
Its job is to predict whether it is a data sample or a synthetic sample.

●Spatio-temporal prediction oriented to big data is mainly to build a prediction model based on 
the characteristics of spatio-temporal objects to predict the behavior or state of spatio-temporal objects 
in a specific spatial location in a specific time range in the future.

●Spatiotemporal big data has a variety of data, which are of different qualities, 
and needs to be combined to learn and predict.
